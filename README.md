# Exploring agriculture trends to highlight global phenomena

# Abstract
People are questioning more and more their eating habits, regarding ethics, ecologic or health issues. Due to misinformation, many people have preconceived notions about those issues and how to be responsible consumers. The difficulty of knowing the actual story behind what goes in your plate is the topic that interests us. We ask ourselves: where does our food come from,  how was it produced?
Using datasets containing insights about food production and trade in the world, we will explore this topic. We will try to find the major actors in terms of agricultural products and countries to understand how trades and production are done nowadays and see what are the current trends and analyze the disparities we might observe.

# Research questions
- What are the most prominent agricultural products in the world, in terms of quantity and trades? 
- Is there a balance between countries and their importation and exportation of agricultural products?
- What is the evolution of the global agricultural production throughout time?
- What are the agricultural effects on a country that is a major exportator?

# Dataset
Our main source of data comes from `FAOSTAT` dataset from the United Nation website. It shows production, land use and other information around treatment of goods. We might later complement our dataset with additional data showing trade statistics, also on the United Nation website (`Commodity Trade Statistics` dataset).

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Download and clean the data set from the FAO Stats (Data wrangling).
- Group some agricultural products in categories (cereals, fruits and vegetablesâ€¦).
- Analyse products on two different dimensions: products-centered versus country-centered in order to find major actors in the current state of agricultural production.
- Compare these observations throughout time. Check modern ways to handle timeseries data.
- Find a good way to visualize all these information on the three following dimensions: geographic coordinates, time and goods. 

# Questions for TAa
We would like to use another dataset (`Commodity Trade Statistics` Database) also coming from the UN data website. Is it a good idea/Is it possible to combine those two?
